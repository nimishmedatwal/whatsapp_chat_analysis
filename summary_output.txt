MESSAGE: Happy Gurupurab to everyone ðŸ©·
MESSAGE: 1. **Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)**
* **What is ML?**
    * ML is a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
    * ML algorithms are trained on data, and then used to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
* **Types of ML**
    * There are two main types of ML: supervised and unsupervised learning.
        * **Supervised learning** involves training a model on a dataset of labeled data. The model learns to associate features of the data with the labels.
        * **Unsupervised learning** involves training a model on a dataset of unlabeled data. The model learns to find patterns in the data without being told what the labels are.
* **Applications of ML**
    * ML is used in a wide variety of applications, including:
        * **Natural language processing**
        * **Computer vision**
        * **Speech recognition**
        * **Machine translation**
        * **Recommender systems**
        * **Medical diagnosis**
        * **Financial trading**
        * **Self-driving cars**

2. **Why is ML important?**
* ML is important because it gives computers the ability to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. This can lead to a variety of benefits, including:
    * **Improved accuracy**
    * **Reduced costs**
    * **Increased speed**
    * **Greater flexibility**
    * **New opportunities**

3. **How to learn ML?**
* There are a number of ways to learn ML, including:
    * **Online courses**
    * **Books**
    * **Tutorials**
    * **Hands-on projects**
    * **Online communities**
    * **Conferences**
    * **Research papers**

4. **Resources for learning ML**
* Here are some resources for learning ML:
    * [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning)
    * [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
